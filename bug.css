The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, using `calc()` with percentages and other units can sometimes lead to unexpected results due to the order of operations or unit incompatibility. For instance, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not always produce the expected outcome if the parent element's size isn't explicitly defined or if other properties affecting the layout are not considered.
